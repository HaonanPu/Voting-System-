# Voting-System-
It's one of my assignment during the forth semester at university. I simply save it on github so that I am able to change the laptop.
Surprise! Basically run the read_vote file and make sure that all those files are in one common folder. You will then see a picture with
weird bars on it. Boring, i guess? But it was worth 8% of my final mark. I believe it is simply a deep practice of list, dictionary and 
functions etc.
